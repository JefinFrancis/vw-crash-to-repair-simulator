## Volkswagen Brand Day \'96 Crash-to-Repair Experience\
\
**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)  \
**Date:** 2026-01-28  \
**Owner:** Jefin (Product Owner)  \
**Client Proxy:** Rohit  \
**Client:** Volkswagen Brazil \'96 Brand/Dealer Marketing (Lucas as primary contact)  \
**Event:** Volkswagen Dealer Brand Day (March 2026)  \
\
---\
\
## 1. Product Overview\
\
### 1.1 Purpose\
\
Build an interactive \'93Crash-to-Repair\'94 digital experience for Volkswagen Brand Day that:\
\
- Uses a realistic racing/crash simulator (BeamNG) to generate vehicle damage data.\
- Transforms crash telemetry into a repair estimate (parts, pricing).\
- Connects that estimate to the VW dealer network (simulated or real data).\
- Demonstrates VW\'92s and Object Edge\'92s capability to:\
  - Turn complex data into intuitive customer/dealer experiences.\
  - Build meaningful, data-driven products extremely quickly using AI-driven development.\
\
This is primarily a **marketing/technology demo**, not a production system, but it should be structured so it can evolve into solving real business problems (e.g., inventory optimization, connected-car crash flows).\
\
---\
\
## 2. Goals & Non-Goals\
\
### 2.1 Goals\
\
1. **Deliver working experience in \uc0\u8804  1 calendar week of focused development time**  \
   - Core E2E flow: crash \uc0\u8594  damage data \u8594  repair estimate \u8594  dealer selection \u8594  \'93appointment\'94.\
2. **Demonstrate \'93new way of building\'94**  \
   - Single lean PO/architect (Jefin) directing multiple AI agents to build the product.  \
   - Minimal manual coding; heavy use of Cloud Code, Opus 4.5, Copilot, etc.\
3. **Create a \'93jaw-dropping\'94 demo for dealers**  \
   - Fun, visually compelling, clear story: \'93You crashed your car, here\'92s what it costs, here\'92s how VW dealers take care of you.\'94\
4. **Lay groundwork for real business value**  \
   - Design so that inventory optimization and real dealer/parts integration can be layered in.\
   - Capture architecture and domain knowledge (ontologies, knowledge graphs, episodic memory) in repo/docs.\
\
### 2.2 Non-Goals (for this phase)\
\
- Real-time, per-millisecond damage/price updates during the race.\
- Full production hardening (SLA, HA, full security review, etc.).\
- Full integration into Palantir (must run **outside** Palantir due to licensing).\
- Complete and accurate coverage of all VW models, all dealers, all parts.\
- Deep financial or SAP/ERP integration.\
\
---\
\
## 3. Users & Use Cases\
\
### 3.1 Primary Users\
\
1. **Dealer Event Attendees (Drivers)**  \
   - VW dealer representatives attending Brand Day.\
   - Use the simulator, crash cars, and see repair estimates.\
\
2. **VW Marketing & Event Staff**  \
   - Operate the experience during the event.\
   - Use big screen to tell the story to the room.\
\
3. **VW Business Stakeholders (e.g., Lucas)**  \

\
4. **Object Edge Internal Stakeholders (Valmor, Rene, Diego, etc.)**  \
   - Support the demo at the event.\
   - Demonstrate AE/consulting capability on top of the demo.\
\
### 3.2 Key Use Cases\
\
1. **UC1: Dealer Drives & Crashes a Car**\
   - User selects a VW model in BeamNG (e.g., T-Cross, Golf).\
   - Drives a race session, inevitably crashes into obstacles or other cars.\
   - Finishes the race.\
\
2. **UC2: \'93Repair My Car\'94**\
   - After race completion, driver presses \'93Repair my car\'94 (inside game or via adjacent UI).\
   - System captures crash/damage telemetry from BeamNG (e.g., via API, CSV export, or memory/snoop mechanism).\
   - System infers which parts are damaged and to what extent.\
\
3. **UC3: Repair Estimate Generation**\
   - Back-end maps damage \uc0\u8594  VW part numbers / part descriptions.\
   - System computes repair cost (parts + optionally labor).\
   - Generates an invoice-like summary.\
\
4. **UC4: Dealer Selection**\
   - UI displays:\
     - Damaged areas.\
     - Required parts list.\
     - Estimated total repair cost.\
   - User selects a dealer from a list (real or simulated VW dealers near the event city).\
\
5. **UC5: \'93Appointment\'94 Creation**\
   - System pretends to schedule an appointment with chosen dealer.\
   - Shows confirmation screen: dealer name, estimated cost, \'93appointment date/time\'94 (stubbed).\
   - Optionally \'93sends\'94 invoice (e.g., simulated email or on-screen confirmation).\
\
6. **UC6: Big-Screen Storytelling**\
   - Event host mirrors the experience on a large screen:\
     - Race/crash sequence.\
     - Transition to repair app UX.\
     - Visual walkthrough of damage, cost, dealer selection, and \'93inventory optimization\'94.\
\
7. **UC7 (Stretch): Inventory Optimization Story**\
   - System checks dealer\'92s (stubbed) inventory for required parts.\
   - If some parts are missing, shows:\
     - \'93Dealer A is missing 3 parts; proposing transfer from Dealer B/C.\'94\
   - Visual narrative of routing parts across the dealer network.\
\
---\
\
## 4. Functional Requirements\
\
### 4.1 BeamNG Integration\
\
**FR-1** \'96 BeamNG Environment Setup  \
- Install and run BeamNG locally on a dedicated event machine.  \
- Ensure at least 2\'963 VW models are available:\
  - T-Cross\
  - Golf\
  - (Optional) Additional VW models if available with minimal extra work.\
\
**FR-2** \'96 Telemetry Extraction  \
- Ability to capture crash/damage data for a completed race. Options (any viable approach is acceptable):\
  - **Preferred:** Use any official/unofficial BeamNG APIs to access:\
    - Per-part damage metrics (panels, suspension, engine, etc.).\
    - Crash event metadata (speed at impact, angle, location on vehicle).\
  - **Fallback 1:** Use existing plugin/module Fernando tested:\
    - On \'93end race\'94 or \'93repair my car\'94, export a CSV file with damage/telemetry.\
  - **Fallback 2:** Use system cache/memory scraping or similar reverse engineering (as discovered via Claude or Copilot) to extract damage state.\
\
**FR-3** \'96 Triggering the Export  \
- Must be able to trigger telemetry export **after the race** (not real time).  \
- Ideal trigger: custom \'93Repair my car\'94 button in-game or adjacent UI that signals the export step.\
\
### 4.2 Damage Interpretation & Parts Mapping\
\
**FR-4** \'96 Damage Parsing Module  \
- Parse the BeamNG output (API or CSV) into a normalized internal format:\
  - Damaged components (e.g., front bumper, left fender, suspension, windshield).\
  - Damage severity/intensity per component.\
  - Car model ID and configuration.\
\
**FR-5** \'96 Parts Ontology / Knowledge Base  \
- Define a simple ontology / mapping for VW car models:\
  - Car Model \uc0\u8594  Assemblies \u8594  Parts (with IDs, names, categories).\
- Use either:\
  - Real VW parts data from GCP (via Rene/Jags if feasible), or\
  - Synthetic dataset with realistic structure and naming.\
\
**FR-6** \'96 Damage-to-Parts Logic  \
- For each damaged component, determine:\
  - Which parts must be replaced vs. repaired.\
  - Quantities (usually 1 per part but flexible).\
- Provide a confidence level for mapping (for potential future tuning).\
\
### 4.3 Pricing & Invoice Generation\
\
**FR-7** \'96 Pricing Data  \
- Attach a price to each part:\
  - Real prices from VW data if available, otherwise simulated prices in realistic ranges.\
- Optional: define labor cost multipliers (per component or per hour).\
\
**FR-8** \'96 Estimate Calculation  \
- Compute:\
  - Parts subtotal.\
  - Optional labor subtotal.\
  - Total estimated repair cost.\
- Apply tax or fees if required for realism (configurable).\
\
**FR-9** \'96 Invoice Object  \
- Generate a structured \'93Invoice\'94 object containing:\
  - Vehicle model & run ID.\
  - List of damaged components.\
  - List of parts (ID, name, quantity, unit price, line total).\
  - Totals (parts, labor, grand total).\
  - Timestamp.\
  - Dealer selection status (pending/assigned).\
\
### 4.4 Dealer & Inventory Logic\
\
**FR-10** \'96 Dealer Directory  \
- Maintain a list of dealers (focus on Brazil, ideally S\'e3o Paulo / Rio):\
  - Dealer ID, name, city, basic contact info.\
- Support a small subset of real or stub dealers attending the event.\
\
**FR-11** \'96 Dealer Inventory (Stub)  \
- For each dealer, maintain simulated inventory:\
  - Part ID, on-hand quantity.\
- Inventory dataset can be static JSON or seeded from sample data.\
\
**FR-12** \'96 Dealer Selection Flow  \
- Allow user to:\
  - Filter or show dealers near a given location (basic filtering is enough).\
  - Select one dealer to handle the repair.\
- Once dealer selected, associate invoice with dealer record.\
\
**FR-13 (Stretch)** \'96 Inventory Check & Optimization  \
- For chosen dealer:\
  - Identify which parts are in-stock vs. missing.\
- If missing:\
  - Show a simple optimization suggestion:\
    - \'93We found missing part X at Dealer B, Y at Dealer C; estimated transfer can complete by [date].\'94\
- Visualization can be simple (e.g., table or mini-map) but should tell a compelling story.\
\
### 4.5 User Experience & Presentation\
\
**FR-14** \'96 Main UX Flow  \
- A web-based or desktop UI separate from the game but easily visible:\
  1. Landing / Idle screen (waiting for \'93Repair my car\'94).\
  2. Damage summary screen:\
     - Car model, crash thumbnail (optional), damage hotspots.\
  3. Repair estimate screen:\
     - Parts list, pricing, totals.\
  4. Dealer selection screen.\
  5. Appointment confirmation screen.\
\
**FR-15** \'96 Big Screen Mode  \
- UX should work well on:\
  - Large event display (projector/TV).\
  - Possibly mirrored from event machine browser.\
- Fonts, contrast, and layout must be legible from a distance.\
\
**FR-16** \'96 Narrative Clarity  \
- Each key screen should visually/verbally answer:\
  - \'93What happened?\'94 (crash impact & damage)\
  - \'93What do we need to fix?\'94 (parts)\
  - \'93What does it cost?\'94 (estimate)\
  - \'93Who will fix it?\'94 (dealer)\
  - \'93How do we ensure parts are available?\'94 (inventory story, if implemented)\
\
### 4.6 Integration & Data\
\
**FR-17** \'96 GCP Data Access  \
- If VW parts/dealer data is in GCP:\
  - Connect to GCP database (read-only).\
  - Extract required tables/schemas for:\
    - Parts.\
    - Pricing.\
    - Dealers.\
- If not feasible in time, use stub datasets with similar schema.\
\
**FR-18** \'96 Repository & Documentation  \
- All code in a single Git repository under Object Edge.\
- Maintain:\
  - `README.md` with setup and run instructions.\
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` with high-level system design.\
  - `DOMAIN_MODEL.md` for the ontology / knowledge graph.\
  - `PROGRESS.md` (AI agents\'92 plan/log file) if using Claude\'92s standard pattern.\
\
---\
\
## 5. Non-Functional Requirements\
\
### 5.1 Performance\
\
- Single race \uc0\u8594  telemetry \u8594  estimate pipeline should complete in **\u8804  3\'965 seconds** under demo conditions.\
- UI transitions must feel snappy; no multi-minute waits.\
\
### 5.2 Reliability & Resilience\
\
- Solution must be stable enough to run multiple demos during the event day:\
  - Handle at least **dozens of runs** without restart.\
- If telemetry extraction fails:\
  - Show a graceful error screen and allow a retry run.\
\
### 5.3 Security & Privacy\
\
- No sensitive PII required; if any emails/names are captured, they may be fake for demo.\
- Local-only deployment for event is acceptable; no need for public internet exposure.\
- If any cloud is used (GCP), secure with standard service credentials; no hard-coded secrets.\
\
### 5.4 Maintainability & Handover\
\
- Design for **support handoff** to Brazil-based team (e.g., Valmor, Rene) for event day:\
  - Clear setup script/process.\
  - Documentation for:\
    - Restarting services.\
    - Common failure modes and quick fixes.\
- Code should be navigable by another dev using AI code assistants with the existing docs.\
\
---\
\
## 6. Technical Approach\
\
### 6.1 Stack\
\
- **Core Development:**\
  - Cloud Code CLI (Claude Code).\
  - Opus 4.5 Max plan (Anthropic).\
  - GitHub Copilot as optional assistant inside VS Code.\
\
- **Runtime / Hosting:**\
  - Initial plan: **local hosting** on event machine (no strict need for cloud deployment).\
  - Optionally: Dockerize and deploy to GCP (Cloud Run or similar) if time allows.\
\
- **Language & Frameworks (proposed, can be adjusted by AI-assisted design):**\
  - Backend: Node.js/TypeScript or Python (choose based on AI plan and dev comfort).\
  - Frontend: React or simple SPA framework (minimize complexity; prioritize speed).\
\
### 6.2 AI-Driven Development Paradigm\
\
- Jefin acts as:\
  - Product Owner.\
  - Architect.\
  - AI \'93team lead\'94.\
- Development pattern:\
  - Use AI agents to:\
    - Generate initial architecture and scaffolding.\
    - Generate and refine modules (BeamNG integration, mapping, UI).\
    - Maintain documentation files.\
  - Minimize hand-written code; focus on:\
    - Requirements.\
    - Architecture decisions.\
    - Reviewing and steering AI-generated code.\
\
### 6.3 Knowledge & Memory Structures (Internal)\
\
- While full ontologies/knowledge graphs are not mandatory for MVP, design to align with:\
  - **Ontologies/Knowledge Graphs**: parts, models, dealers, inventories.\
  - **Entity Dossiers**: cars, dealers, invoices as structured entities.\
  - **Episodic Memory**: each race/repair session logged with key facts (for future analytics/features).\
\
---\
\
## 7. Event-Day Operational Requirements\
\
**OP-1** \'96 Local Support  \
- At least one engineer/consultant onsite (likely Valmor or Rene) must be able to:\
  - Start/stop the app.\
  - Connect app to BeamNG on the event machine.\
  - Handle basic troubleshooting.\
\
**OP-2** \'96 Offline Mode  \
- System should function with limited or no external internet:\
  - All critical data (models, parts, dealers) cached locally.\
\
**OP-3** \'96 Demo Scripts  \
- Prepare a simple facilitator script:\
  - Steps, talking points, and key moments to highlight.\
  - \'93If something fails, here\'92s the backup story/demo path.\'94\
\
---\
\
## 8. Open Questions & Assumptions\
\
### 8.1 Open Questions\
\
1. Exact structure and accessibility of VW parts/dealer data in GCP:\
   - Who provides credentials?\
   - What schemas are available?\
2. Can we modify BeamNG UI to add a native \'93Repair my car\'94 button, or do we need an external trigger/companion app?\
3. How many dealers and which regions should be represented for the Brand Day narrative?\
4. Level of realism required for pricing (approximate vs. actual VW pricing).\
5. Any legal/brand guidelines from VW regarding:\
   - Showing crash damage.\
   - Showing repair costs.\
\
### 8.2 Assumptions\
\
- VW will accept end-of-race batch processing; real-time in-race pricing is not required.\
- Marketing goal > technical perfection: visual impact and story clarity take precedence over full data accuracy.\
- It is acceptable to stub or simulate parts of the flow (inventory, appointment scheduling) as long as:\
  - The narrative is honest about what\'92s real vs. simulated.\
- Object Edge will have rights to showcase the solution (with VW approval) in case studies.\
\
---\
\
## 9. Milestones & Timeline (for 1-Week Build)\
\
**Day 0\'961**\
- Finalize PRD (this document) with Rohit and Jags.\
- Jefin:\
  - Sets up BeamNG.\
  - Investigates telemetry access (including Fernando\'92s module).\
- AI agents generate initial architecture, repo scaffolding, and data models.\
\
**Day 2\'963**\
- Implement BeamNG \uc0\u8594  normalized damage pipeline.\
- Implement basic ontology & parts mapping with stub data.\
- Implement core backend services and API endpoints.\
\
**Day 4**\
- Implement UI:\
  - Damage summary.\
  - Estimate view.\
  - Dealer selection.\
  - Confirmation.\
\
**Day 5**\
- Integrate with GCP data if feasible; otherwise refine stubs.\
- Add inventory check & simple optimization (if time).\
- Stabilization, smoke testing, and documentation.\
\
**Post-Week**\
- Iterations with Lucas and VW team (2\'963 days):\
  - UX tweaks.\
  - Narrative refinements.\
  - Data adjustments.\

\
---\
\
## 10. Acceptance Criteria (MVP)\
\
The product is considered MVP-complete when:\
\
1. From a completed BeamNG race, a user can:\
   - Trigger \'93Repair my car\'94.\
   - See a coherent damage summary.\
   - See a parts-based repair estimate with a total cost.\
   - Select a dealer.\
   - View a final confirmation screen.\
\
2. The entire process (race end \uc0\u8594  confirmation screen) functions reliably on the target event machine for multiple runs.\
\
3. VW stakeholders can understand, in one guided walkthrough:\
   - How the crash leads to data.\
   - How data leads to a repair estimate.\
   - How this could be extended to real parts, real inventory, and connected-car scenarios.\
\
4. All code and documentation are in the Git repo with enough detail for another engineer (with AI tools) to support/extend the solution.\
